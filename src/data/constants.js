    description: `
      1) Our team sends a daily report on WhatsApp, which includes information on the total number of users who have install & logged into the app in the last week, as well as monthly and yearly summaries. To streamline this process, I have automated it using Python and Selenium.
      2) Our team monitors server services using the Nagios tool, Zookeeper Tool. Specifically, we keep an eye on server load. If the server load exceeds a certain threshold, we initiate a process to back up the data and delete data older than one month. Our database is hosted on a Cassandra server, and to facilitate this task, I have created a script that logs into the Cassandra database to check for available disk space. If the disk space is running low, it triggers the backup and deletion of older data. This script is scheduled to run as a cron job every half hour.    
      3) Our team sends a daily report, which includes both Report and Report Chart, through a Python script with a scheduled cron job. This report fetches data from both MySQL and Cassandra databases by logging in with the appropriate credentials. The report provides the following information:
          a) Total number of not reporting trackers.
          b) Trackers that have gone into sleep mode for today, the last week, the last 15 days, the last month, and those inactive for more than a month.
          c) Deactivated trackers.
          d) Trackers currently in use.
          e) The total count of installed trackers up to the present.
          f) Percentage of trackers that are not reporting.
          g) Trackers that haven't reported in the last 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 1 day, and 1 to 12 months.
          h) Identifying which trackers are not working and whether their respective customers have requested service.
          i) Checking if escalated service calls have been completed.      
          Additionally, the script generates beautiful charts using Matplotlib to visualize the data.      
      4) Every night, our customer support team maintains an Excel sheet with data. Customers often request changes to various fields such as ignition state, speed in kilometers per hour (kph), odometer reading, average speed, stop time, signal strength, and reason codes. To address these requests, I have created a Python script that runs at midnight. This script automates the data updates in accordance with each customer's specific requirements by executing individual update queries for each field.
      5) Essentially, each tracker is equipped with a SIM card. As part of our services, we have contracts with three different SIM providers: Airtel, Idea, and Vodafone. These SIM cards are used for two primary purposes: enabling customers to receive messages and providing internet connectivity for GPS tracking. To manage this, I've developed a Python script that runs every midnight. This script systematically evaluates each SIM card and, if necessary, replenishes the balance to ensure seamless operation.
      6) I've also written a script that assesses the total tracker sales from the previous day. Our business is associated with two key partners: HDFC and ICICI. This script helps us determine the number of trackers sold by HDFC, the number sold by ICICI, and the third category tracks sales made by our customer support team.
      7) I've developed a Flask web application for our customer support team. This app allows team members to input a user ID and configure various alerts, such as message alerts, speed alerts, parking alerts, idling alerts, towing alerts and other types of alerts, according to their needs.
      8) I've developed a python script for Convert latitude and longitude coordinates into a human-readable address & Convert an address into corresponding latitude and longitude coordinates."
      9) Collecting data from various sources, including Excel, CSV files, and URLs, and then using this data to create a pivot table and generate an analysis report.
      10) I've written a Python script to automate searching for contacts or groups, sending messages, and sending attachments in WhatsApp. I used Selenium for browser automation.
